# GitHub Issues Creation Script

I've created a Node.js script to automatically create GitHub issues for your robolog project based on the improvements you outlined.

## What's Included

The script creates **12 comprehensive issues** organized into 4 categories:

### Bug Fixes (3 issues)
1. **Fix edge cases in log deduplication that incorrectly merge distinct errors**
   - High priority bug affecting error reporting accuracy
   - Labels: `bug`, `priority:high`, `component:analyzer`

2. **Improve error handling and retry logic for Ollama inference failures**
   - Medium priority reliability improvement
   - Labels: `bug`, `priority:medium`, `component:ai`, `enhancement`

3. **Resolve potential race conditions in queue management**
   - High priority concurrency issue
   - Labels: `bug`, `priority:high`, `component:core`, `concurrency`

### UX Improvements (2 issues)
4. **Enhance dashboard with richer visualizations of log trends and issue frequencies**
   - Dashboard visualization enhancements
   - Labels: `enhancement`, `priority:medium`, `component:dashboard`, `ui/ux`

5. **Simplify webhook integration with guided onboarding for popular platforms**
   - Onboarding and user experience improvements
   - Labels: `enhancement`, `priority:medium`, `component:webhooks`, `onboarding`, `ui/ux`

### Reusability Improvements (4 issues)
6. **Modularize and document Node.js Analyzer codebase for easier customization**
   - High priority architecture and documentation improvement
   - Labels: `enhancement`, `priority:high`, `component:analyzer`, `architecture`, `documentation`

7. **Abstract Fluent Bit configuration for better Linux distribution support**
   - Cross-platform compatibility improvements
   - Labels: `enhancement`, `priority:medium`, `component:fluent-bit`, `platform-support`

8. **Abstract Ollama and AI model into a Lambda function**
   - Serverless architecture option
   - Labels: `enhancement`, `priority:medium`, `component:ai`, `serverless`, `architecture`

9. **Provide hosted AI API option as alternative to self-hosting**
   - High priority user experience improvement
   - Labels: `enhancement`, `priority:high`, `component:ai`, `cloud-integration`, `user-experience`

### Fine-Tuning Possibilities (3 issues)
10. **Fine-tune Gemma 3n on domain-specific log data for improved diagnostic accuracy**
    - Research project for AI improvement
    - Labels: `research`, `priority:low`, `component:ai`, `machine-learning`, `fine-tuning`

11. **Experiment with model pruning and quantization for optimization**
    - Performance optimization research
    - Labels: `research`, `priority:low`, `component:ai`, `performance`, `optimization`

12. **Develop specialized submodels for specific infrastructure environments**
    - Advanced AI specialization research
    - Labels: `research`, `priority:low`, `component:ai`, `specialization`, `infrastructure`

## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **GitHub Personal Access Token**: You need a GitHub token with `repo` permissions
   - Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
   - Create a new token with `repo` scope
   - Copy the token value

### Running the Script

1. **Set your GitHub token**:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
   ```

2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   node create_issues.js
   ```

### What the Script Does

1. **Creates issues sequentially** with a 1-second delay between each request (to be respectful to GitHub's API)
2. **Provides detailed progress output** showing which issues are being created
3. **Handles errors gracefully** and continues with remaining issues if one fails
4. **Shows a summary** of successfully created issues with links

### Expected Output

```

## Issue Structure

Each issue includes:
- **Clear title** describing the improvement
- **Detailed description** with problem statement and proposed solutions
- **Implementation ideas** and technical considerations
- **Priority level** (High/Medium/Low)
- **Appropriate labels** for categorization and filtering
- **Benefits and expected outcomes**

## Security Notes

- **Keep your GitHub token secure** - never commit it to version control
- **Use environment variables** to pass the token to the script
- **Consider using GitHub CLI** as an alternative authentication method

## Customization

You can easily modify the script to:
- Change issue content or add more issues
- Modify labels or priorities
- Adjust the delay between API calls
- Add additional metadata like assignees or milestones

The script is designed to be maintainable and easy to understand for future modifications.
